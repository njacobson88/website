**Mood Triggers** is a comprehensive Android and iOS-compatible application designed to help users identify and manage triggers of anxiety and depression in their daily lives. Developed over several years by Dr. Nick Jacobson and his research team, Mood Triggers utilizes advanced smartphone sensing technology, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and ecological momentary intervention (EMI) to provide personalized feedback and support.

**Key Features:**

1. Personalized Monitoring: Keep a detailed diary of your anxiety and depression levels through regular self-assessments prompted by the app.
2. Health Behavior Tracking: Automatically monitor health behaviors such as heart rate, steps taken, and sleep duration using your smartphone's sensors.
3. Passive Sensing Technology: Utilize passive data collection to gain insights into patterns related to mood fluctuations without the need for constant active input.
4. Personalized Feedback: Receive tailored feedback based on your data to help identify factors associated with changes in your mood, including heart rate, physical activity, social interactions, and environmental conditions.
5. Ecological Momentary Interventions: Access evidence-based interventions and coping strategies delivered in real-time to address anxiety and depression symptoms as they occur.

**Research and Development:**

Mood Triggers has been extensively validated in research across multiple studies and institutions. The application captures indicators of:

* Psychomotor Agitation: Daytime accelerometer activity to assess restlessness or increased activity levels.
* Sleep Disturbances: Nighttime accelerometer data, GPS information, and screen unlock patterns to monitor sleep quality and duration.
* Behavioral Activation: GPS data to evaluate levels of engagement in daily activities.
* Social Contact: Analysis of calls, texts, and social activity (while maintaining strict privacy) to understand social engagement.
* Light Exposure: Sensor data to assess exposure to natural light, which can impact mood.
* Heart Rate Variability: Facial photoplethysmography (PPG) using deep learning algorithms to measure stress and relaxation responses.
* Screen Time: Monitoring device usage patterns as they relate to mood and mental health.
Mood Triggers serves as both a self-help tool and a platform for researchers. It helps users improve awareness of their mood over time and can be used in conjunction with mental health professionals to provide deeper insights into individual experiences of anxiety and depression.

**For Researchers:**

Mood Triggers is a valuable resource for researchers interested in utilizing smartphone sensing and EMA/EMI platforms in mental health studies. Its capabilities include:

1. Passive Sensing Data Collection: Gather extensive data on participant behaviors and environmental factors without imposing additional burdens.
2. Ecological Momentary Assessment: Capture real-time self-reported data on mood and symptoms.
3. Ecological Momentary Intervention: Deliver interventions at the moment they are most needed, increasing their effectiveness.
4. Personalized Feedback Mechanisms: Analyze data to provide individualized insights, enhancing participant engagement and outcomes.
