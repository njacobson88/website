# Biography


Dr. Nick Jacobson is an associate professor in the departments of Biomedical Data Science, Psychiatry, and Computer Science at Dartmouth College's Geisel School of Medicine. He serves as the Director of the Treatment Development and Evaluation Core within the [Center for Technology and Behavioral Health](https://www.c4tbh.org/meet-our-team/nicholas-jacobson/) and leads the [AI and Mental Health: Innovation in Technology Guided Healthcare (AIM HIGH) Laboratory](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/jacobsonlab/).

Driven by a passion to transform mental health care through technology, Dr. Jacobson focuses on harnessing artificial intelligence and passive sensor data from smartphones and wearable devices to develop scalable, personalized interventions for anxiety and depression. His expertise lies in creating personalized just-in-time adaptive interventions and advancing quantitative tools that enable this work.

A pioneer in the field, Dr. Jacobson developed [Therabot](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/pjqmr), a generative AI therapy chatbot crafted over five yearsâ€”predating the release of ChatGPT by years. Developed with over 100,000 human hours by the Jacobson Lab, Therabot represents a significant advancement in digital therapeutics. In the first randomized controlled trial of a fully generative AI therapy chatbot, Therabot demonstrated substantial reductions in symptoms of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and feeding and eating disorders. Participants reported exceptional therapeutic alliance, comparable to human therapists. Therabot's groundbreaking impact has been recognized by [NBC Nightly News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/dartmouth-researchers-look-meld-therapy-apps-modern-ai-rcna146558).

In his commitment to leveraging technology for mental health, Dr. Jacobson also developed [Mood Triggers](../project/mood-triggers/), an Android and iOS compatible smartphone sensing platform. This application integrates ecological momentary assessment and intervention, providing personalized feedback to help users identify and manage triggers of anxiety and depression in their daily lives. His suite of smartphone applications has reached over 50,000 users in more than 100 countries, exemplifying his dedication to making mental health support accessible globally.

As a computational psychologist, Dr. Jacobson created the [Differential Time-Varying Effect Model (DTVEM)](../project/dtvem/), an innovative statistical package in R that allows researchers to discover and model optimal lag times in intensive longitudinal data. His methodological expertise encompasses machine learning, structural equation modeling, multilevel modeling, time-series techniques, and dynamical systems modeling.

With over 110 peer-reviewed publications, Dr. Jacobson has secured more than $6 million in funding as Principal Investigator and over $20 million as a co-Investigator. His influential research has been featured on [CBS Morning News](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/ai-powered-apps-working-to-detect-mental-health-problems/), highlighting his pioneering work in using AI-powered apps to detect and treat mental health problems.
