# Biography

Nick Jacobson is a tenure-track assistant professor in the departments of Biomedical Data Science and Psychiatry within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health in the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College. His research interests include the comorbidity between anxiety and depression, the role of technology in assessment and treatment, and longitudinal data analysis. He recently developed an anxiety and depression monitoring application entitled [Mood Triggers](/project/mood-triggers/) which helps users to learn the triggers of their anxiety and depression in their daily lives. He also created an statistical package (written in R) called the [Differential Time-Varying Effect Model (DTVEM)](/project/dtvem/) which is used to explore optimal time lags in intensive longitudinal data.
