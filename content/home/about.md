# Biography

Nick Jacobson is a clinical fellow in psychology at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School. His research interests include the comorbidity between anxiety and depression, the role of technology in assessment and treatment, and longitudinal data analysis. He recently developed an anxiety and depression monitoring application entitled [Mood Triggers](/project/mood-triggers/) which helps users to figure out the triggers of anxiety and depression in their daily lives. He also created an statistical package (written in R) called the [Differential Time-Varying Effect Model (DTVEM)](/project/dtvem/) which is used to explore optimal time lags in intensive longitudinal data.
